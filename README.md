# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. Players can take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 board, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. This game features a responsive and interactive user interface, allowing players to enjoy the timeless game on any device.

## Features

- Two-player game: Play against a friend locally on the same device.
- Score tracking: Keep track of the number of wins for each player.
- Reset button: Reset the board and start a new game.
- Simple and intuitive UI.
